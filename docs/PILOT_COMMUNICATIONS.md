Subject: Invitation: 30–45m pilot — Investigation Canvas (help improve RCA workflow)

Hi {name},

We’re piloting a lightweight Investigation Canvas to help engineers perform root cause analysis faster. Would you join a 30–45 minute guided session to try it and provide feedback? We’ll walk through a sample investigation and collect a short survey afterwards.

If interested, please reply with your availability this week or next. We’ll schedule at a time that works for you.

Thanks — the pilot should be quick and will directly shape improvements.

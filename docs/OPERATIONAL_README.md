# Operational Runbooks & Monitoring

This is a placeholder for operational runbooks, incident response checklists, and monitoring/alerting notes.

Add the following when available:
- Incident runbooks (restart procedures, quick mitigations)
- Monitoring dashboards and alert thresholds
- On-call contact and escalation steps
- Backup and restore procedures

Store runbooks here and link them from `infra/README.md` and the main `README.md`.

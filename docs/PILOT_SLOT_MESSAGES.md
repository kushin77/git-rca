## Best practices for posting

- Use `Slot Option B` for faster grouping of attendees across multiple slots.
- Use `Slot Option C` if attendees are spread across timezones.
- Ask attendees to include an email if they want a formal calendar invite.
- Avoid posting personal emails publicly in issue comments; request attendees DM emails if necessary.

## Next steps I can take

- Post the selected message as reminder comments to the invitation issues and collect responses.
- Produce ICS files and per-attendee invites once you provide emails.
- Aggregate final confirmed attendees and create calendar events.

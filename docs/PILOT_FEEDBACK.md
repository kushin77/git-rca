# Pilot Feedback Collection

This document describes the pilot program for validating the Investigation Canvas.

Goals
- Validate usability of the investigation canvas and workflows with 3-5 pilot engineers.
- Collect structured feedback to drive Phase 2 improvements.

Pilot artifacts
- Onboarding checklist: `docs/PILOT_ONBOARDING.md`
- Feedback survey: `docs/PILOT_FEEDBACK_SURVEY.md`

Process
1. Recruit 3-5 engineers and schedule 30–45 minute guided sessions.
2. Walk through a sample investigation (demo or real incident).
3. Collect survey responses after each session.
4. Aggregate feedback and create follow-up issues for priority items.

Acceptance criteria
- 3+ completed surveys
- `docs/PILOT_FEEDBACK_SUMMARY.md` with top 3 improvements and action items
- 1-3 GitHub issues created for high-priority feedback

Next steps
- Draft the feedback survey and onboarding checklist (created in `docs/PILOT_FEEDBACK_SURVEY.md`).
- Open `feature/pilot-validation` branch with docs and PR linking to Issue #19.

RSVP Aggregator Run — 2026-01-27

Summary:
- Aggregator executed: `scripts/aggregate_rsvps.py`
- Result: Appended 76 RSVPs to `docs/PILOT_RSVP_TEMPLATE.md`
- File updated and pushed to `main` (commit: chore: append aggregated RSVPs (auto))

Notes:
- Attempted to post a summary comment to follow-up issue #28 via `gh`, but the `gh` invocation failed in this environment. The summary has been saved here; if you want, I can retry the `gh` command with additional auth context or post the message via the GitHub API.

Next steps:
1. Generate per-attendee ICS invite drafts and add to `docs/ICS_INVITES/`.
2. Post second reminders to invitation issues lacking RSVPs (use `docs/PILOT_SLOT_MESSAGES.md` templates).
3. Update and close completed issues in the repository.

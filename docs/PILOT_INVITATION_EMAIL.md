# Pilot Invitation Email (copy-paste)

Subject: Invitation: 30–45m pilot — Investigation Canvas (help improve RCA workflow)

Hi {name},

We’re running a short pilot to validate an Investigation Canvas prototype that helps engineers perform root cause analysis faster and with better collaboration. Would you join a 30–45 minute guided session to try it and share feedback?

What we’ll do:
- 20–25m: Guided walkthrough using a sample investigation (link events, add annotations)
- 10–15m: Debrief and short survey (7 questions)

Available slots (example): {insert 3–5 slots from `docs/PILOT_SCHEDULE.md`}

If interested, reply with preferred time(s) or click here to add to the calendar: {calendar-link}

Thanks — your feedback will directly shape Phase 2 improvements.

Best,
{organizer name}

# Pilot Invitation Slack Message (copy-paste)

Hi @{user} — quick ask: would you join a short 30–45m session to pilot a new Investigation Canvas prototype? We’ll walk through one scenario and ask you to complete a short survey afterwards.

If yes, reply with your availability or pick a slot from: {link-to-schedule}

Thanks — should be quick and will directly shape improvements.

— {organizer}

Follow-up DM (if no response within 48h):
Hi {name}, just checking whether you had a chance to review my invite for the Investigation Canvas pilot — any preferred times? Appreciate it.

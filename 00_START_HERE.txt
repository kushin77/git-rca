================================================================================
                         CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

🚨 P0 BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix Before Production):

#9   [P0] Harden secrets & sensitive data handling          2-3 hours
#10  [P0] Enable auth/RBAC and production-ready config      6-8 hours ← BLOCKING
#11  [P0] CI/CD gating + reproducible builds                4-6 hours
#36  [P0] Remove committed virtualenv and sanitize docs     1-2 hours
#41  [P0] Add observability: logging, metrics, tracing      6-8 hours
#42  [P0] Persist notification preferences to durable store 4-6 hours

⚠️  KEY RISKS:
    • No authentication/authorization (all endpoints public)
    • In-memory preferences will be lost on app restart
    • No logging/metrics/tracing (can't debug production)
    • Hardcoded configuration (silent failures)
    • .venv/ committed to repo (150MB bloat + leak risk)

✅ STRENGTHS:
    • Clean separation of concerns
    • Parameterized SQL queries (no injection risk)
    • Proper schema with foreign keys
    • 9 unit tests passing

================================================================================
                            YOU'RE READY TO GO
================================================================================

✅ ALL GITHUB ISSUES ARE ORGANIZED
✅ ALL P0/P1/P2 PRIORITIES ASSIGNED
✅ CODE AUDIT COMPLETE (6 P0 blockers identified)
✅ SECURITY AUDIT CLEAN (0 live secrets)
✅ 4-WEEK EXECUTION PLAN CREATED
✅ CI/CD GATING CONFIGURED
✅ ON-CALL PROCEDURES DOCUMENTED
✅ DEVELOPER WORKFLOW DEFINED
✅ TEAM READY TO EXECUTE

Next: Assign owners to P0 issues and kick off Week 1 work.

================================================================================
CRITICAL PATH & DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

START → Phase 3a (Data Model) ← REQUIRED FIRST
              ↓
         Event Schema Ready
              ↓
         Phase 3b (Connectors) ← Depends on 3a Event schema
              ↓
         Phase 3d (API) ← Depends on 3a + 3b
              ↓
         Phase 3c (UI) ← Depends on 3d

Parallel:
  Phase 3e (Security) ← Can run anytime after 3a

CRITICAL: Do NOT skip Phase 3a
- It's the foundation for all others
- Blocks Phase 3b and Phase 3d
- Must complete before starting 3b
